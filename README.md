# MCLA Model Repository	

This repository, mclamodels, serves to hold and store various models, textures and templates for the City of MCLA and its operations. 

Please note, textures and models that are added to The MCLA Mod (mclamod) should NOT be added here, to avoid duplicates. Texture templates and model templates may be added if not duplicated.
